# GitHub-Copilot Hackathon

## Introduction

Through the application, users can easily create new tasks, providing relevant information such as title, description and due date. Input validation ensures that the input data is accurate and complete, preventing any discrepancies or errors. Additionally, users can update existing tasks, change information as needed, and mark tasks as complete when they are finished. The application also lets you delete tasks when they are no longer needed or required. This ensures a clean and organized to-do list, allowing users to focus on current priority tasks. The program interface is intuitive and user-friendly, facilitating seamless interaction and a pleasant user experience.
With the aid of GitHub Copilot and the combination of C# and the.NET Framework, a powerful task management application that simplifies task tracking and boosts productivity is produced.
